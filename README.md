Project Summary:

This responsive pet adoption platform leverages modern frontend practices to deliver a smooth UI/UX. The navigation bar adapts to screen sizes with a collapsible mobile view. A banner section includes a scroll trigger ("View More") linking to the dynamic adoption section. Pet categories and listings are fetched via API and rendered using template literals. Sorting by descending price is supported. Each pet is displayed in a card component, with fallback values for missing fields. A like system stores favorite pets and displays them in a right-aligned grid layout. Clicking "Details" launches a modal with extended data. The adoption flow includes a countdown animation. The layout is fully responsive, including the footer.


Core Functionalities:

1. Adoption Countdown Timer – Adds an interactive UX touch before adoption is finalized.

2. Details Modal – Populates a modal component with extended pet data on click.

3. Anchor Scroll Navigation – Uses smooth scrolling for better single-page UX.

4. Like Component – State-driven liked items shown in a responsive grid.

5. Sort by Price – Implements a basic sort algorithm to reorder pet cards.


ES6 Implementation Highlights:

• let/const for block scoping and data integrity

• fetch() + Promises for clean API interaction

• Template Literals to build dynamic HTML snippets

• Arrow Functions for concise syntax and lexical
